libaw README.
=============

WHAT?

A simple and portable window handling library suitable for use in small
OpenGL applications.

WHY? 

GLUT and SDL are simply huge. They try to do too much. I don't want
their threads abstraction / font rendering / sound output / widgets /
whatever. Those things should be handled by separate libraries. I just
want to open a damn window and draw some OpenGL stuff on it. And I
want to remain in control of the program all the time. If I want
callbacks, I'll implement them.

Also, this library is quite simple and should be easy to integrate in
interpreters.

BUILDING

- Install scons ( http://scons.org )
- Type 'scons' in this directory. 

This should build a dynamic library and some test programs.
